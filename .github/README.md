### About the actions secrets under workflows

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: it will be assigned automatically by GitHub Actions, you don't need to do anything.
- `GH_TOKEN`: When you are using these actions on Gitea, setup-python@v5 needs the access to install python from Github; so you need to assign it manually.
- `GT_TOKEN`: Your personal access token for Gitea if you need.
